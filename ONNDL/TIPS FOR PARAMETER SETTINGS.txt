Most of the parameters don't need tuning, except the update frequency and affine parameters. Here are some tips for tuning them:

1) For update frequency, most videos work under the setting of 5. For some videos that the object varies or occludes greatly, please change it to 3.

2) For affine parameters, The first two indicates the translation, default parameter is 4, 4. If the object move fast, please change it to 6, 6 or even 8, 8. If the scale of the object changes fast, please change the third and fifth parameter to 0.02 and 0.005.
